So the man sued the two doctors and their practices for defamation and medical malpractice and, last week, after a three-day trial, a Fairfax County jury ordered the anesthesiologist and her practice to pay him $500,000.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff, identified in court papers only as \u201cD.B.,\u201d wanted to maintain his anonymity and did not want to comment about the case, said his attorneys, Mikhael Charnoff and Scott Perry. </p>\n<p>The anesthesiologist, Tiffany M. Ingham, 42, could not be reached for comment, and her attorney, D. Lee Rutland, did not return messages seeking comment. Ingham worked out of the Aisthesis anesthesia practice in Bethesda, Md., which the jury ruled should pay $50,000 of the $200,000 in punitive damages it awarded. Officials there did not return a call seeking comment. Ingham no longer works there, an Aisthesis employee said, and state licensing records indicate that she has moved to Florida. An anesthesiology practice in Tavares, Fla., said she no longer worked there. Calls to a number believed to be Ingham\u2019s were not returned, and there was not an answering machine or voicemail at that number. </p>\n<p channel=\"wp.com\" class=\"interstitial-link\">\n<i>[<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2015/04/13/18ecc874-d309-11e4-ab77-9646eea6a4c7_story.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Opinion: Nurses make fun of their dying patients. And that\u2019s okay.</a>]</i>\n</p>\n<p>On the opening day of the trial last week, the gastroenterologist who performed the colonoscopy, Soloman Shah, 48, was dismissed from the case. Court documents state Shah also made some insulting remarks \u2014 \u201cAs long as it\u2019s not Ebola, you\u2019re okay,\u201d Shah was recorded saying during the rash discussion \u2014 and did not discourage Ingham from her comments or actions, which included writing on the man\u2019s chart that he had hemorrhoids, when he did not.</p><div></div>\n<p>Neither Shah, who did not return a message left at his office, nor the lawyers on either side would comment.</p>\n<p channel=\"wp.com\" class=\"interstitial-link\">\n<i>[<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2015/06/24/case-of-doctor-caught-trashing-man-during-surgery-comes-amid-push-for-cameras-in-operating-rooms/\">A movement is afoot to put cameras in operating rooms</a>]</i>\n</p>\n<p>The lawyers also would not discuss whether Ingham or Shah faced disciplinary action from the Virginia Board of Medicine. No actions are listed against either on the board\u2019s Web site.</p>\n<p>The jury awarded the man $100,000 for defamation \u2014 $50,000 each for the comments about the man having syphilis and tuberculosis \u2014 and $200,000 for medical malpractice, as well as the $200,000 in punitive damages. Though the remarks by Ingham and Shah perhaps did not leave the operating room in Reston, experts in libel and slander said defamation does not have to be widely published, merely said by one party to another and understood by the second party to be fact, when it is not.</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of a case like this,\u201d said Lee Berlik, a Reston lawyer who specializes in defamation law. He said comments between doctors typically would be privileged, but the Vienna man claimed his recording showed that there was at least one and as many as three other people in the room during the procedure and that they were discussing matters beyond the scope of the colonoscopy.</p>\n<p>\u201cUsually, all [legal] publication requires is publication to someone other than the plaintiff,\u201d Berlik said. \u201cIf one of the doctors said to someone else in the room that this guy had syphilis and tuberculosis and that person believed it, that could be a claim. Then it\u2019s up to the jury to decide: Were the statements literal assertions of fact? The jury apparently was just so offended at this unprofessional behavior that they\u2019re going to give the plaintiff a win. That\u2019s what happens in the real world.\u201d</p>\n<p>One of the jurors, Farid Khairzada, said that \u201cthere was not much defense, because everything was on tape.\u201d He said that the man\u2019s attorneys asked for $1.75\u00a0million and that the $500,000 award was a compromise between one juror who thought the man deserved nothing and at least one who thought he deserved more.</p>\n<p>\u201cWe finally came to a conclusion,\u201d Khairzada said, \u201cthat we have to give him something, just to make sure that this doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d</p>\n<p>The colonoscopy took place in Shah\u2019s surgical suite on April 18, 2013, according to the man\u2019s lawsuit. While being prepped for the procedure, the man apparently told Ingham that he had passed out previously while having blood drawn and that he was taking medication for a mild rash on his genitals.</p>\n<p>Because he was going to be fully anesthetized, the man decided to turn on his cellphone\u2019s audio recorder before the procedure so it would capture the doctor\u2019s post-operation instructions, the suit states. But the man\u2019s phone, in his pants, was placed beneath him under the operating table and inadvertently recorded the audio of the entire procedure, court records show. The doctors\u2019 attorneys argued that the recording was illegal, but the man\u2019s attorneys noted that Virginia is a <a href=\"http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?000+cod+19.2-62\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"leg1.state.va.us\">\u201cone-party consent\u201d state</a>, meaning that only one person involved in a conversation need agree to the recording.</p>\n<p>The recording captured Ingham mocking the amount of anesthetic needed to sedate the man, the lawsuit states, and Shah then commented that another doctor they both knew \u201cwould eat him for lunch.\u201d</p>\n<p>The discussion soon turned to the rash on the man\u2019s penis, followed by the comments implying that the man had syphilis or tuberculosis. The doctors then discussed \u201cmisleading and avoiding\u201d the man after he awoke, and Shah reportedly told an assistant to convince the man that he had spoken with Shah and \u201cyou just don\u2019t remember it.\u201d Ingham suggested Shah receive an urgent \u201cfake page\u201d and said, \u201cI\u2019ve done the fake page before,\u201d the complaint states. \u201cRound and round we go. Wheel of annoying patients we go. Where it\u2019ll land, nobody knows,\u201d Ingham reportedly said.</p>\n<p>Ingham then mocked the man for attending Mary Washington College, once an all-women\u2019s school, and wondered aloud whether her patient was gay, the suit states. Then the anesthesiologist said, \u201cI\u2019m going to mark \u2018hemorrhoids\u2019 even though we don\u2019t see them and probably won\u2019t,\u201d and did write a diagnosis of hemorrhoids on the man\u2019s chart, which the lawsuit said was a falsification of medical records.</p>\n<p>After declaring the patient a \u201cbig wimp,\u201d Ingham reportedly said: \u201cPeople are into their medical problems. They need to have medical problems.\u201d</p>\n<p>Shah replied, \u201cI call it the Northern Virginia syndrome,\u201d according to the suit.</p>\n<p>The doctors argued that the Vienna man did not suffer any physical injury or miss any days of work. The man\u2019s complaint said that he was \u201cverbally brutalized\u201d and suffered anxiety, embarrassment and loss of sleep for several months.</p>\n<p>\u201cThese types of conversations,\u201d testified Kathryn E. McGoldrick, former president of the Academy of Anesthesiology, \u201care not only offensive but frankly stupid, because we can never be certain that our patients are asleep and wouldn\u2019t have recall.\u201d</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>\n<b>More on medical malpractice from The Post:</b>\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2015/01/28/what-went-wrong-with-joan-riverss-last-medical-procedure-lawsuit/\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">What went wrong with Joan Rivers\u2019 last medical procedure: Lawsuit</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/specials/immigration/cwc_d1sidebar.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">E-mails show attempt to \u2018patch up\u2019 a case of medical negligence</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A11126-2005Apr23.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">How malpractice suits keep my profession honest</a>\n</p>\n<p>\n<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/local/wp/2014/07/21/190-million-settlement-proposed-to-patients-secretly-videotaped-by-doctor/\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">Johns Hopkins agrees to $190 million settlement over patients being secretly videotaped</a>\n</p><p>\n<a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/10/AR2010081006149.html\" title=\"www.washingtonpost.com\">\n</a><a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/10/AR2010081006149.html\">Md. woman wins $2.35 million in malpractice case</a>\n</p>\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong></strong></p>\n</article>",

    "description": " A Vienna man went in for a colonoscopy and intended to record his doctor\u2019s post-op instructions, because you\u2019re groggy after coming out of anesthesia. inadvertently recorded the entire procedure (audio only) on his cell phone. And it turns out his doctor and anesthesiologist fully trashed him. A wimp. Want to punch him in the face. He\u2019s got a rash on his penis, is it syphilis or TB? I don\u2019t want to talk to him afterwards, tell him I already did and he forgot. I\u2019m going to put \u2018hemorrhoids\u2019 on his chart, even though he doesn\u2019t have them. Stuff like that. Defense claimed the conversation was private, not published to a 3d party (there were, however, other non-doctors in the room), the recording was illegal, and the patient had no real damages beyond his claimed anxiety and embarrassment for a couple of months. Plaintiff said he had anxiety and embarrassment for months.<br/> The plaintiffs dismissed the doctor on the day of trial and just went to trial against the anesthesiologist. (Her comments were the most inflammatory.) They got $100,000 for defamation, $200,000 for medical malpractice and $200,000 in punitives. $500,000 total. A talker.",
